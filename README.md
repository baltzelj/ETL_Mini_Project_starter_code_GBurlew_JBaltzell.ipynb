## Description and Objective
This is the second project in the UofO Bootcamp. The [Project 2 instructions](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/5163/assignments/78000?module_item_id=1238696) are linked in the description. Below is the navigation required to find our turn in samples.

### Resources Folder
These are the resources that were used for the final SQL Database. They were created using the python file linked below.
1. [Capaign CSV](Resources/campaign.csv)
2. [Category CSV](Resources/category.csv)
3. [Contacts CSV](Resources/contacts.csv)
4. [Subcategory CSV](Resources/subcategory.csv)

[Python File](ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code.ipynb)

[Crowdfunding SQL Schema](crowdfunding_db_schema.sql)

  [ERD Created from Schema](Project2ERD.png)

## Features
This application functions in two parts. Part 1 used the python file above to create dataframes using the two Excel files, [Crowdfunding](Resources/crowdfunding.xlsx) and [Contacts](Resources/contacts.xlsx). The file then exports the dataframes into CSV files. Part 2 used SQL to construct dataframes for analysis.
